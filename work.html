        <h1>My Favorite Band: Imagine Dragons</h1>
        <p>Why they are my undisputed #1.</p>

        <p>Imagine Dragons is easily the best band of all time for me, and it really comes down to consistency. When I
            look at my own ratings across every album, they just score higher than anyone else. Almost every track is at
            least an 8 or 9 for me, and most bands might get a handful of songs at that level, but Imagine Dragons does
            it album after album. Night Visions, Smoke + Mirrors, Evolve, Origins, Mercury—each one has multiple songs I
            never skip. When I add up my personal ratings, no other artist even comes close.</p>

        <p>But it’s not just the numbers. Their sound hits every mood. They’ve got the emotional stuff, the hype songs,
            the introspective ones, and somehow it all fits their style. I like that they’re not afraid to mix genres or
            try something different, and it still ends up sounding like them. It’s the one band I can listen to no
            matter what I’m doing—driving, studying, working, whatever. So for me, based on both the way I score their
            music and just how often I actually choose to listen to them, Imagine Dragons is at the top without
            question.</p>
